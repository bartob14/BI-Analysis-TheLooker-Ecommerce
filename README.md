# How I Helped TheLook eCommerce Boost Profits and Improve Product Performance

## What is TheLook eCommerce?
TheLook eCommerce is a global clothing retailer offering a diverse range of products. Women's clothing contributes 49% to total sales, but challenges remain in optimizing product performance across categories. The company aims to boost profitability and improve customer segmentation to align with consumer behavior and enhance marketing efforts.

## This Project
**Project Goals and Motivation**
The main objectives of this project were to analyze product performance, customer segmentation, and marketing effectiveness, in order to deliver actionable insights for optimizing product strategy, inventory management, and marketing campaigns.

**Demographics and Product Preferences**


*Insight:* TheLook eCommerce serves a diverse age range, with customers aged between 12 to 70 years old. The average customer age is 41 years, indicating that most customers are working professionals with families. 
*Action:* Aligning product offerings and marketing strategies with customer demographics could lead to higher conversion rates and personalized shopping experiences.



**Sales by Country and City**



*Insight:* The top contributing cities are Shanghai, Beijing, and Seoul, with Brazil, the United States, and China leading overall sales by country. 
*Action:* Focus marketing efforts and optimize localized inventory in high-performing regions to improve profitability and operational efficiency.



**Product Category Performance**



*Insight:* Sweaters and jeans drive over 35% of total revenue, while lower-performing categories like accessories contribute to a 10% profit margin decline. 
*Action:* Adjust pricing strategies and inventory for underperforming categories to maximize profit margins while expanding successful product categories.


**Traffic Source Performance**



*Insight:* Search traffic generated the highest revenue and maintained a 30% profit margin, making it the most valuable traffic source. 
*Action:* Invest more in search marketing, while optimizing organic and paid channels to improve customer acquisition and revenue.



**Revenue Impact of Churn and Sales Trends**



*Insight:* Monthly revenue loss due to churn amounted to $20,000, with notable sales spikes in Q4 due to the holiday season, showing a 34% revenue increase compared to Q3. 
*Action:* Implement retention strategies to reduce churn and leverage sales seasonality to maximize revenue.


**Forecasting Future Sales Trends**



*Insight:* Revenue projections show significant growth under the best-case scenario, while the worst-case scenario forecasts a 30% revenue drop in 2024 due to economic downturns, with recovery by 2028. 
*Action:* Use scenario planning to optimize inventory and vendor relationships while preparing for potential market disruptions.
